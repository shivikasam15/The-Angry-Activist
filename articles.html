  <h1 id="GW">Global Warming</h1>
    <h2>What is the greenhouse effect?</h2>
<p>The greenhouse effect is the strategic release and containment of heat from
  the earth. Greenhouse gases such as methane and carbon dioxide are the gases
  which absorb infrared radiation from the sun. Greenhouse gases are contained
  in the atmosphere around the earth. Infrared radiation bounces off the surface
  of the earth and is then absorbed by the greenhouse gases in the atmosphere
  while some escapes. It is then radiated back towards the Earth’s surface from
  the atmosphere.</p>
<h2>Where does global warming come in? </h2>

<p>When there is an increase in greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, more infrared
  radiation is absorbed heating the atmosphere and the earth even more. This
  increase in the average temperature is harmful to the environment since entire
  ecosystems and species survive in specific temperature ranges. Coral reefs,
  for example are affected by coral bleaching. Corals when healthy, have a
  symbiotic relationship with zooxanthellae (they rely on each other for their
  continued survival). The zooxanthellae live in the polyps and is the coral’s
  primary food source. It produces pigments which give colour to the coral. When
  the coral becomes stressed due to the temperature, the algae is expelled from
  the polyps. Due to the coral using its main food source, it turns white.</p>

  <p>Buccoo Reef is just off the coast of Tobago, Trinidad and Tobago, and
    houses 25% of all marine organisms. According to Dr Anjani Ganase’s article,
    “The Buccoo Reef Crisis: Facts and Fiction” on the blog Wild Tobago, there
    have been “multiple mass coral bleaching events, disease outbreaks, frequent
    physical damages and a regime of declining poor water quality.” </p>
    <p>Fun Fact: Tobago is home to the world’s largest single brain coral colony
      measuring 10ft (3m) high and 16ft (5.3m) across. It’s a little way off
      Speyside and Little Tobago.</p>

    <p>According to the World Resources Institute in the article, “Tobago: A
      Sustainable Future for Buccoo Reef,” the economic contribution associated
      with Buccoo Reef is estimated at US $7 to $8.8 million per year. The
      Buccoo Reef also protects a developed section of Tobago’s shore from
      erosion and storm damage, avoiding an estimated US $5.6 to $10 million per
      year in damages.</p>
      <p>Conservation measures taken:</p>
      <ul class="charlie">
        <li>The Marine Area (Preservation & Enhancement) Act of 1970 (in 1973)</li>
        <li>The Preservation and Enhancement Regulations established legislation for the Buccoo Reef Restricted Area (in 1974).</li>
        <li>The Institute of Marine Affairs (IMA) prepared a Management Plan on behalf of THA (Tobago House of Assembly) in 1994. However, the only recommendation implemented was the appointment of a park manager.</li>
        <li>It is in the process of being designated an Environmentally Sensitive Area under the Environmental Management Act (2000) (It was proposed in 2004)</li>
        <li>The Buccoo Reef is also protected by the Ramsar Convention.</li>

    <div class="textcenter">Trinidad and Tobago, A Small Island Developing State</div>
</div>
  <h1 id="SIDS">Trinidad & Tobago, A Small Island Developing State</h1>
  <p>Trinidad and Tobago is one of the 16 Caribbean Small Island Developing
    States (SIDS). Small Island Developing States are considered to be on the
    “front lines of climate change.”</p>
  <p>While most SIDS rely heavily on fossil fuels, Trinidad and Tobago also
    produces and exports fossil fuels despite the closure of Petrotrin and the
    opening of the Heritage Petroleum Company Limited and Paria Fuel Trading
    Company Limited. However, production has significantly reduced since 1996 as
    seen by the graph below.</p>

    <p>While Small Island Developing States are among the least responsible of all
    nations for climate change, they will suffer from the effects of climate
    change. The Caribbean is known to produce some of the most plastic waste in
    the world which is why Barbados has banned all petrol-based, single-use
    plastic since April 1st, 2019. While placing a ban may seem simple, they had
    to offer alternatives first.</p>
  <p>This raises the question of what local businesses are doing to support
    eco-friendly living and how the public is being encouraged to make better
    decisions.</p>
  <h3>Massy Stores</h3>
  <p>Massy Stores, located in Trinidad and Tobago, Barbados, St. Lucia, St
    Vincent and the Grenadines and Guyana with 48 stores had begun charging for
    single use plastic bags while a reusable option was made available led to an
    80%-90% reduction in the circulation of single use plastic bags which has
    translated to over 40.5 million bags being removed from circulation between
    2018-2019 alone. Additionally, they have begun to change their lighting
    systems to LED to reduce their energy consumption. They have switched to
    solar systems in Barbados and St Lucia and have switched to ozone friendly
    fuel for their air conditioners and refrigerators. They have also partnered
    with environmental agencies across the region.</p>
  <h3>The Carbon Zero Initiative of Trinidad & Tobago (CZITT)</h3>
  <p>The Carbon Zero Initiative of Trinidad & Tobago (CZITT) is a non-profit
    organisation involved in awareness, advocacy, programmes and projects geared
    towards the reducing and offsetting of greenhouse gas emissions. Some of
    their projects include the Climate Quiz, Project Zero and 1000 Trees
    Challenge. In the National Secondary Schools’ Climate Quiz, 112 schools in
    Trinidad and Tobago. The top 16 schools were then invited to develop a
    project which fights against climate change and create a video on the project.
    Five schools took up the challenge with ASJA Girls’ College San Fernando
    placing first, Naparima Girls’ High School placing second and Naparima College
    placing third. In Project Zero, St Augustine Girls’ High School and
    Presentation College attempted to make their schools carbon neutral. Finally,
    in their 1000 trees challenge, CZITT partnered with schools, clubs,
    corporations to plant and record trees. They mainly planted moringa trees and
    are developing a local moringa industry for export.</p>
  <h3>Environmental Management Authority’s (EMA) iCARE Project</h3>
  <p>The Environmental Management Authority was formed by the Government of the
    Republic of Trinidad and Tobago’s Ministry of Planning and Development. They
    introduced The Recyclable Solid Waste Collection Project (RSWC) in 2015 as a
    successor to Beverage Container Collection Project. It was then branded as the
    iCARE Program through sponsorship by the Green Fund. Part of the iCARE Program
    is public education where it encourages citizens to separate their beverage
    containers and drop it off in one of their iCARE Collection Bins in a clear
    or frosted bag. ICARE has established over 80 collection bins nationwide.</p>
  <h3>The Last Straw and More</h3>
<p>The Last Straw and More is a local (Trinidad and Tobago) company owned by
  Sangeeta Praimsingh. Plastic straws are part of the plastic problem, it is
  projected that by 2050, 99% of all sea bird species will have ingested plastic.
  Plastic straws, like most plastic waste, end up in the oceans due to littering,
  improper disposal etc. The company manufactures and sells hand-made, locally
  produced bamboo straws among other eco-friendly, reusable items. The straws are
  made from bamboo grown in Trinidad and are hand-made. They are distributed at
  Praimsingh’s in Curepe and the Santa Cruz Green Market. They can be contacted
  through their Facebook page, The Last Straw & More TT. They use their platform
  to educate by posting information on the negative impact that single-use straws
  can have on the environment.</p>

</div>
<h1 id="5r">The 5 R’s</h1>
<p>We are all used to hearing Reduce, Reuse and Recycle but there are 5R’s in
  sustainability, and they are:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Refuse- Saying NO to single use plastics and products that use excessive plastic wrapping. </li>
  <li>Reduce- Buys goods that will last longer and cut back on your purchasing of short-span items and items that you don’t have any intention of using.</li>
  <li>Reuse- Replace single-use items that can be used several times. Where possible, instead of tossing out, find a way to repurpose items.</li>
  <li>Recycle- After the first 3 steps, you recycle your remaining plastics, glass, paper and metal.</li>
  <li>Rot- Kitchen scraps can be left to rot or compost.</li>
</ol>
<p>Many recyclables are made of non-renewable resources such as fossil fuels and
   natural gas. Thus, it is imperative that we try to conserve these resources
   through the reduction of use and the recycling of that which was already used.
   For instance, fossil fuels are used to make plastics. Additionally, Carbon
   Dioxide is a by-product of fossil fuel combustion. In the recycling process,
   recyclables are sorted if necessary, crushed and/or shredded, washed and made
   into pellets which can then be used to make new items. This process helps
   reduce landfill content, reduce the amount of recyclables being produced being
   produced and keeps most of it out of waterways.</p>
   <ol>
     <li>EMA’s iCARE Project- They collect plastic, glass and tin beverage containers as well as tetra packs. You are required to rinse the items and place them in a clear garbage bag if possible (no black garbage bags). There are over 80 collection bins nationwide where you can drop off your bags.</li>
     <li>ACE Recycling Limited- They collect wastepaper. You are simply required to drop it off at their location in Arima.</li>
     <li>Carib Glass- They recycle and collect at several locations across Trinidad.</li>
     <li>Green Warriors- You can recycle your batteries. Collection bins are located at:Xtra Foods (Chaguanas & Arima), Super Quality (Chaguanas & Trincity), All Massy Stores. And in Tobago:Bhagan’s Drugs (Gulf City Mall, Lowlands), Milford Road Gas Station.</li>
     <li>Recyclage E-Waste Management Limited- They dispose of electronics using environmentally welcoming techniques. They also have a zero-landfill policy for E-Waste. They pick-up when contacted.</li>
     <li>Piranha International Limited- They dispose of E-waste, glass, tin, paper, plastic, waste, oil etc.</li>
